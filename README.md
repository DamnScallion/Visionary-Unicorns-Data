# 🚀Visionary-Unicorns-Data
### Contain original Penguins vs Turtles dataset from Kaggle in the data fold
### https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abbymorgan/penguins-vs-turtles

# 🔥Project Migration
### This repo was created for us to work with the same data directory. So we don't have to code separately within our own Google Drive directory.
### More important, we can run anyone's cells in Colab though it wasn't written by you. Cuz it wasn't mounted with a personal Drive anymore 🔗‍💥
### Unfortunately, Google Colab doesn't support clone private repo. So we need to keep it public.

# ⚙️Usage
### Step 1: Open project.ipynb notebook file

### Step 2: Clone the repo to Google Colab notebook, run the below command in Colab cell first
##### !git clone https://github.com/DamnScallion/Visionary-Unicorns-Data.git

### Step 3: Click the folder icon 🗀 on the Colab notebook left-hand side, will see the folder names Visionary-Unicorns-Data

### Step 4: Copy and paste your code in the project.ipynb

### Step 5: Change all paths to align with the Visionary-Unicorns-Data folder

### Step 6: Happy coding 💀
