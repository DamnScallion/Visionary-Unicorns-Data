# 🚀Visionary-Unicorns-Project
### Contain original Penguins vs Turtles dataset from Kaggle in the data/original folder
### https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abbymorgan/penguins-vs-turtles

# 🔥Project Migration / Integrate all in one
### This repo was created for us to work with the same data directory. So we don't have to code separately within our own Google Drive directory.
### More important, we can run anyone's cells in Colab though it wasn't written by you. Cuz it wasn't mounted with a personal Drive anymore 🔗‍💥
### Unfortunately, Google Colab doesn't support clone private repo. So we need to keep it public.
